# ModelDiscovery [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/model_discovery.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/model_discovery)

ModelDiscovery is a simple yet flexible and fast solution to model discovery problem in Ruby on Rails applications. Detecting applications model in a Rails application is a bit hard because of [autoload](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveSupport/Autoload.html) convention, specially when you use set of gems which add their own models to your application.

ModelDiscovery provides a solution to this problem without loading models in runtime. If you're familiar with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) framework, you can think ok ModelDiscovery as something like **ContentType** application in Django.

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'model_discovery'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install model_discovery

Then add this line to your `db/seeds.rb` file:
```ruby
ModelDiscovery::Engine.load_seed
```
## Usage

ModelDiscovery will add a model to your application which will contains all the models class name. So you can use active record's query to fetch model names like:
```ruby
# Fetch all models class names
models = ApplicationModels.all
# => ["User", "Group", "SomeGem::ModelExample"]

# Access to actual class of a model
model_class = models[0].constantize
# => "User"

# It's like User.all
model_class.all
```
It's simple isn't it ?
